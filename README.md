# Bitcoin price Skill for Amazon Alexa

An hour long weekend hack project to try out Alexa developer kit and AWS Lambda. Currently a very simple and dumb application that makes a coindesk API call to get the price.

#### TODO
- Allow date range for prices
- Allow users to buy bitcoins via Coinbase or other service
- Allow users to send bitcoins to friends.
